### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Relationships of Philosophy Sentences and Other Factors
+ This project is conducted by Ruiyu Zhang

+ Project summary: This report analyzed The History of Philosophy dataset for the purpose of finding potential relationships between philosophy sentence lengths and factors like publication date, author, and school. Along the way, interesting findings on the history of philosophy are also reported. And, at the end stage, relationships of philosophy sentences with different authors and their frequencies are represented by wordclouds plots to produce a clearer view of frequency of words in sentences.
